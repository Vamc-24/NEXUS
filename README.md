We built a 3‑tier AI system where students submit feedback via a web interface.
The backend uses NLP embeddings and clustering to group similar feedback, then uses a language model to generate concise problem statements and actionable solutions.
The system stores results in Firestore and helps college management make data‑driven decisions.
